# Tips on how to conduct interviews :tada:

The aim of user testing is **to get the most honest responses from people**

### Fundamentals
1. Make people feel relaxed and comfortable enough to not have to 'impress' you with answers or for there to be a 'right' answer.
2. You must not ask people things in a way that influences how they answer.  

### Phrasing of questions
Pay special attention to the wording of your questions and openness. 'What did you think of ....?' instead of 'Did you like......?' etc

In a restaurant a waiter often might check back with you once your food has arrived.  

**Bad example:** 'Is everything ok?'  
This is a bad question because the expected answer is either yes or no and saying NO sounds very bold and rude, something you'd only be likely to say if the food was awful._

**Good example:** 'how is everything?' or 'how is your food?'  
Then it's a more open question which encourages the guests to say, 'it's lovely but my chips are too salty.'  
This question means there's a wider choice of answers and the way it's phrased encourages the guest to give more honest feedback that doesn't sound overtly rude.  

A lot of people wouldn't feel very comfortable answering 'is everything ok?' with 'no' because of how blunt it is.

### Setting the scene
+ Say hi, introduce yourself (and anyone else with you e.g. someone who might be taking notes)
  + Ideally have a second person taking notes to record what they're saying and also to observe things like facial expressions or body language if they're of note.
+ Ask them their name and thank them for coming
+ Explain what the other person with you is doing 'This is Jen, don't worry about her, she'll just be writing some notes during our chat but don't worry about her, it's just to help us remember things'
+ Explain what the session will entail:  
> I want you to explore this new product I'm going to show you. It's a very free exercise so there are no right or wrong ways of doing things, this is not about you getting something wrong or right, we're looking to learn about the application. So that we know how you're finding it, we want you to talk aloud whatever you're thinking. So as you explore it, tell us anything that comes into your mind.  

+ Give whatever context you might have e.g. if you think it's relevant to say 'this is a mental health app for teenagers'  
_Or_, depending on what/why you're testing, you may specifically decide _not_ to give context.
+ Enable the person to start using the app. Ideally you should let them do it on their own device, this is recommended as they already feel comfortable using their own device. But it may not always be possible.
+ You may also wish to record the screen and audio but it's worth checking first with audio to be polite to the person involved.
+ If the person asks you a question during the exercise 'shall I click here?' try to reverse it back to them without answering - e.g. 'What do you think?'  
This way you won't shape their actions but you'll learn why they feel drawn towards a certain feature or behaviour
+ Once the app demo is over you can then ask any pre-designed questions you may have, such as demographic/profile info about the individual to put their feedback on the app into context. E.g. what's your occupation? etc etc. depending on what you're looking to learn in the user research
start with softer ones and save any more personal ones to after you've warmed up with easy ones
+ Always ask them if they have any questions for you at the end of the session

### Remember
Remember that people will not have done user testing before. So you need to explain the basics to them.

User testing is no good if the person sits there clicking through in silence.
You need to know every little thought they're thinking and so instructing them to behave like this at the beginning is important.  
**"Please say whatever comes to your mind."**  

You may choose to give context about the limitations of its functionality  
**"This is an MVP and so don't be alarmed if certain aspects of it don't work yet.""**  

Give context about why they're coming to the app. You might do a bit of "research" first, by asking them to browse the homepage for example and offer their thoughts out loud.

But if you're doing usability testing, you probably want to give them a direct task to accomplish  
**"Imagine that you have a train to catch at 6pm, and want to know which bus will take you there & when it leaves."**

In cases where you're trying to test a certain user group but can't access them specifically for testing  
**'Imagine you're a 40-50 year old...'**
